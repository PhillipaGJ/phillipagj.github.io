Phillipa got her BA from St. John's College, Annapolis MD, a Classics program focusing on writing and classroom discussion. Her senior essay "Is Economics Natural?" was on Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_. 

She has worked in business analysis, distaster restoration, commercial auto liability insurance, and organic farm labor. 

Phillipa grew up in a small town and helped found a community development group there. She started a student community service club at college, and has volunteered in various teaching and anti-hunger programs.

She loves to hike and bike around the Twin Cities and do small woodworking and craft projects.
