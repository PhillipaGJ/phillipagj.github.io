    "text": "title:“Introduction”\n#A Little Bit About Phillipa\nPhillipa got her BA from St. John’s College, Annapolis MD, a Classics program focusing on writing and classroom discussion. Her senior essay “Is Economics Natural?” was on Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations.\nShe has worked in business analysis, distaster restoration, commercial auto liability insurance, and organic farm labor.\nPhillipa grew up in a small town and helped found a community development group after the proposal of a new tire-burning plant split the town. She started a student community service club at college, and has volunteered in various teaching and anti-hunger programs.\nShe loves to hike and bike around the Twin Cities and do small woodworking and craft projects."
